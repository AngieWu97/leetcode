# 184. 部门工资最高的员工（中等）

```sql
SELECT 
    d.Name AS Department,
    e.Name AS Employee,
    e.Salary AS Salary
FROM
    Employee e,
    Department d
WHERE e.DepartmentId = d.Id AND
      (d.Id,e.Salary) IN (SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary) 
                            FROM Employee
                            GROUP BY DepartmentId)
```

用了subquery选取各个部门的最大薪资，而不是在原query里直接用`GROUP BY` + `MAX()`，是因为同部门的**最大**薪资可能有**多个**人。
